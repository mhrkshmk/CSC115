# CSC115 - Fundamentals of Programming 2
Coursework from CSC 115 at UVic (Spring 2022)

This course will introduce abstract data types and recursion, examine and apply these concepts within the context of an object-oriented approach to programming, introduce techniques for reasoning about the efficiency of algorithms and data structures and study foundational approaches to organizing data and computations.

Topics:
- A review of programming in Java
- The design, definition and manipulation of simple data objects
- The implementation of lists, including both sequential (linked) and random access (array) variations
- The implementation of stacks, queues, binary trees, and hash tables; with applications
- An introduction to polymorphism: class hierarchies, interfaces, and generic types
- Problem decomposition using recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies
- Techniques for describing the time and space requirements of data structures and their operations
- The efficiency of common searching and sorting approaches
